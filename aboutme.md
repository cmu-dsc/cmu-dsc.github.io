|  I am a junior in SCS studying Computer Science. Outside of DSC, I’m working on CV/ML research, trying out new recipes to cook, and listening to tech podcasts! I really like to travel and learn about people’s cultures and history, ask me about Ethiopia or Qatar!  | I am a PhD student working in cosmology. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, quantitative finance, and solving social problems with interesting data. I enjoy playing piano, and rarely say no to a trip, having been to over a hundred cities in 20 countries. Learn more about me and what I do at [www.husni.space](www.husni.space)  | My name is Tony Wang and I am a sophomore studying Computational Finance with an additional major in Statistics and Machine Learning. I am passionate about how we can leverage data science skills to gain insights from data and how these insights can guide us to make better decisions. In my spare time, I love music. And traveling  |
