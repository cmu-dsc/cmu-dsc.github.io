Being the largest data science organization at Carnegie Mellon (626 registered members), we offer exciting opportunities to our sponsors, through our resume book, and our reach when it comes to co-hosting and promoting events. As our organization involved completing projects, we can also identify members who do outstanding data science work. In the future, we are aiming to provide more opportunities by organizing annual datathons. If you are interested in sponsoring us and would like to discuss, please send us an email to [zheyew@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:zheyew@andrew.cmu.edu).

We are proud to be sponsored by
