Welcome to the Carnegie Mellon University Data Science Club's page! With our 600+ members, we organize a variety of events, from talks and workshops in data science, machine learning, and statistics, to semester-long projects, and bi-weekly kaggle meetups.


At DSC, our goal is to provide an incubator for students at CMU interested in Data Science. We aim to create an active community of interdisciplinary innovators in Data Science.

We look forward to seeing you at our next event!
